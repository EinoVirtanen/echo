------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is created in C. It was made for Aalto-University's course Internet Protocols in the spring of 2016 by Samu Toimela, Eino Virtanen and Nicholas Kukka.

The program is tested to be working with **linux**. Mostly with Debian Jessie.

**Usage:** make and make sure you have ***src/storage*** directory. Server is run by executing the server.o file and client by executing the client.o.
